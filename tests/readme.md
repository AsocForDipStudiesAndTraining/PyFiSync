# Tests

These tests are driven by `py.test`. They are not all formal unit-tests but rather tests the overal behavior.

Note that the tests use the default configuration. If that is changed, tests should be carefully updated!

## Failed Tests

When running the `test_pre_post_bash` with coverage and python3, it throws errors. They work find but not with coverage!
